# plainTextToCue 
 plainTextToCue v 0.1
 
 Sometimes you can run into a long track which has a list of titles available but you need to make a cue sheet by hand to split it into separate MP3 files.
 
 This script converts generic text files with HH:MM:SS or MM:SS track start times to an MP3 cue file.
 
 It needs [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) to run. If you don't have Node.js please install it first.
 
 USAGE:
 
    node plainTextToCue.js mytextfile.txt > mycuefile.cue
 
 You can also change the file and use it in the browser if you like. The function which converts your plain text to CUE is  plainTextToCue.
